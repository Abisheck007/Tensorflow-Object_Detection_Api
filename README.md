# üêç TensorFlow Object Detection API - Custom Training & Inference

Welcome to my repository for learning and experimenting with the **TensorFlow Object Detection API (TFOD API)**.  


---

## üìå Overview
The TensorFlow Object Detection API is an open-source framework built on top of TensorFlow that makes it easy to:
- Train state-of-the-art object detection models
- Use pre-trained models for transfer learning
- Evaluate trained models with metrics like mAP, precision, and recall
- Export and deploy models for real-world inference

This repo documents my **complete workflow**: from dataset preparation to training and real-time detection.
